# CSCI-331 Section 6 — Sudoku Project

Implement a solver for a Customized Sudoku Puzzle using constraint satisfaction
techniques. The base rules of Sudoku apply that each row, column, and region must contain all
digits without repetition. You are required to implement and use two algorithms: (1) plain
backtracking search and (2) backtracking enhanced with CSP methods such as forward
checking or arc consistency. Do some research on what customization could be done in this
game, and solve the same customized puzzle. Report the difference in efficiency between the
two algorithms and explain why the CSP-enhanced version performs better


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed

## How to run

To run the main script from the project root:

```bash
python board.py
```

## TODO

1. Implement CSP version
